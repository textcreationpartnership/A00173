            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt therefore to delineate the time, I muſt ſomewhat touch the raigne of Pope <hi>Adrian, Alexanders</hi> predeceſſour, who being the only man of our English nation that euer ſteered ſaint Peeters ship, and was not only for his ſingular vertues, wiſedome and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:663:6"/> learning preferred to the Apoſtolike Sea, but alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Apoſtle who conuerted the Norwegyans to the Chriſtian faith, I thinke it no vnneceſſary digreſsion to treate of his origine, progreſſe, and moſt high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
            <p>At Abbotts Langley in the County of Hertford, neere kinges Langley,<note place="margin">Nicolas Breake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Pope Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, borne in England.</note> where Edmund of Langley receaued his firſt breath, from whom all the kinges of England and Scotland haue theſe many yeeres deſcended, was borne <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Breakeſpeare,</hi> who afterwarde exalted to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Rome, and called <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, ruled in matters of faith and Religion, the whole Chriſtian world. His father was <hi>Robert Breakeſpeare</hi> a yonger brother of the family of Breakeſpeare, whoſe place concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the name is ſeated neere <hi>Vxbridge</hi> in <hi>Middelſex</hi> now in the poſſeſsion of Ashby. His father (ſaith <hi>Iohn Stowe</hi>) after the death of his wife, and before the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as I conceaue) of his ſonne out of the realme, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a Religious life in the Monaſtery of ſaint Abbans; wherein Stowe ignorantly, not maliciouſly ran into an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> mother (as shall bee afterwards showed) ouerliued him. It appeareth in a Counſell cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in Normandie by Pope Alexanders Legates with the Archbishop of Roane and Bishops of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince <hi>anno Dom. 1172.</hi> how before that time men might enter into religion leauing their wiues in the world, for there was made a Canon afterwards prohibiting it. And ſo might <hi>Robert Breakeſpeare</hi> in this precedent age (as it is affirmed) bee a Monke in ſaint Abbans, and his wife (as it is certaine) ledd a retyred life vnder the Archbishop in Canterbury. The name of Breakeſpeare bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly English, and about the time of the Conqueſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincibly proueth they were of the Saxon not of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. <hi>Breakeſpeare</hi> it ſelfe was in the raigne of king Iames the inheritable manſion of a knight, and how great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:663:6"/> in forepaſſed dayes, God knoweth.

            <p>But the people of Rome exceedingly crying out againſt this intolerable abuſe, and extending their vttermoſt forces againſt thoſe ſenators, who were authors of this miſcheife, the Cleargy with their elected Pope were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of this thraldome; yet malice ſoe preuayled, as they were inſtantly by the ſame ſenators, beeing wonne thereunto by rewards, caſt into another more ſtreyght and cloſe impriſonment beyond Tyber, where beeing almoſt three dayes in hould, the whole Citty roſe to redreſſe ſo greate an enormity, and ſuch an apparant treaſon, yea woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children deteſting Octauian, exclaymed againſt him, calling him an accurſed man, an <hi>Hereticke,</hi> reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, reuyling him, and thirſting after Alexander, in ſo much as to his very face they contemned and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him.

            <p>Octauian on the other ſyde reſiding at ſaint Peeters, the two Cardinals Iohn and Guido blinde with their hellish error, would not reclayme themſelues from their damnable preſumption, but with headlong rebellion honored their erected Idol, and leauing the Churches vnity, fell at his feete; and hee the shadowe of Antichriſt, ſoe exalted aboue himſelfe,<note place="margin">Octauians ſciſme.</note> vſurped the Chayre, as if hee had bin lawfull Pope; which many with weeping eyes and exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe beehoulding, remembred what Pope Anaſtacius as it were profecying, foretold him in theſe wordes: Accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and excommunicated ſonne, thou shalt neuer haue this papal ornament, which thou ſoe much thirſteſt and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſeekeſt, but to thyne owne ruine, and the confuſion of many.

            <p>The Emperour now ſeeing the whole Chriſtian world (except himſelfe) followe Pope Alexander, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded but not conuerted; for ſtanding on his owne power hee knewe the limitts of his Empire to bee extraordinarily enlarged, and allmoſt all Italie ſubiect to his Dominion; moreouer hee feared, if Pope Alexander preuayled, hee should looſe his Emperiall courtes; ſtraitghtned therfore in this ſorte, beeing a man of a great witt and deepe policy, hee beegan to deuiſe how hee might with a generall aſſent of the Church haue both Alexander and his Idol Octauian depoſed, and a third elected: And beecauſe, like will to like, hee made choyſe of Henry Count of Trey, in whom hee repoſed especiall truſt,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the King of France.</note> to bee heerein his ſtrength and aſsiſtance.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:663:24"/> way to make a perfect vnion in the Romane Church, which was, that the Emperour for the pure loue of God deſired that they two, beeing the greateſt Princes of this parte of the world, should at Auinion, a towne confining on both theyr dominions, aſſemble together the Cleargie and Layety both of the Empire and France, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to bring with him Octauian and his complices, and the King, Alexander with his Cardinalles, and there the election of them both beeing diligently examined by the Clergie of Italy, Germany and France, to determine then what was beſt and moſt profitable to the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Common wealth. The king out of his pious dispoſition too confident, and conſidering the great miſcheifes which aroſe vpon this diſcord, condeſcended to the Count, promiſing his ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the Emperour for effecting this matter. Wherupon the Count returning to the Emperour in Lumbardy, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this on the kinges beehalfe with his oathe. Hence spread an euill rumor through Italy to the greife of all good Catholikes, fearing leaſt heereby the Churches liberty should bee endangered. Againſt the day the Emperour with his Princes and puiſſant army came to the appoynted place, and Octauian with his ſcyſmaticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates followed. The king with his Clergie and nobility haſtened alſo thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, meeting in the way at Saluian with Pope Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where honoring one an other, they conſulted two dayes about this appoynted aſſembly, but beeing a thing not only vnworthy, but alſo contrary to the Churches Canons, that the Papacy beeing the higheſt ſeate, should bee ſubiect to any earthly iudgment, it was agreede by all, that only ſome of the principall Cardinalles should bee ſent to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the world the lawefull election of Pope Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Octauians title to bee but a fryuolous impoſture.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:663:24"/> trayne came by Diion to Mount Saon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth France from Germany, expecting there what the Emperour would propound. Wherefore the Arch here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Octauian, ſeeing the Reuerent Cardinalles of the Church of Rome, and the Cleargy of France conſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing againſt him, beeing afrayd of his tryal, complayned to the Emperour, that his aduerſary Alexander diſdayned to appeare, and himſelfe whoſe cauſe was in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours preſence confirmed at the Counſell of Pauy, muſt yet come to a new examination. Wherupon the Emperour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed with anger, ſent the king word that bee had broken his couenant, and falſifyd his oath, beccauſe hee brought not Alexander to the place. The king therfore aduiſing with his counſell, anſwered, that allthough hee could lawfully excuſe the Popes abſence, yet becauſe hee would not derogate from his regality or renowne, nor bee tayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any deceyte, bee it eyther iuſt or vniuſt, hee would preſently without any diſsimulation ſend for the Pope and his brethren thither. And ſoe inſtantly poſted away meſsingers to call the Pope and Cardinals thither with speede, or otherwiſe to ſignify that hee muſt yeeld himſelfe a captiue into the Emperours handes, according as it was couenanted betweene them. Wherupon the Pope and Cardinals ſeeing the king thus entangled in the Emperours ſnares, were marueylously troubled, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how they were on all ſides bee ſet with dangers, for if they wente thyther to vndergoe the iudgment of men,<note place="margin">The Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Kinge of France in danger to bee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> they ſaw the Churches liberty hazarded by violence; if they went not, but ſuffered the king to bee enthralled by the Emperour, they could expect nothing for themſelues but impriſonment and loſſe of all. For the Emperour was not only dreadfull with his owne mighty army, but had alſo the kinges of Denmarke and Behemia with his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and powers there vnited with him, intending, as it ſeemed, to accomplish in that parlee the malice which hee

But god who neuer forſaketh his, ſuffered not the Pope and king to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey to the Emperour, for hee ſtyrred vp the ſpirit of the glorious king of England with a powerfull army of reſolute ſouldiers to march speedily and couragiously againſt the Emperour,<note place="margin">The King of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds couragious attempt to deliuer the Pope and King of France out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Whereunto the king ſmiling anſwered, that hee wondred a wiſe man would ſend ſoe foolish a meſſage; asking if hee were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Chriſt committed his flocke to ſaint Peeter and his ſucceſſors, or whether hee could euer proue that the king of France and his Prelates were any where excepted, as beeing not sheepe of that flocke.<note place="margin">

Soe theſe two kinges diuided long in bloudy warres, agreed both in one to honor in this ſorte ioyntly together Chriſtes vicar.

After whoſe dimiſsion the king went to Abſalon Bishop of Roſchildens his foſter brother and faythful freind, a man of rare vertues, grauity and wiſedome, to whom lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all open, hee declared his intended iourney, deſiring the Bishop to accompany him. The Bishop diſcouering Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derickes deceytes, condemned them, aſſuring hee could not without violating his religion, entertayne the Emperours freindship, beeing more paſsionately then iuſtly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this ſcyſme, and for his owne parte, that hee was altogether vnprouided for ſuch a iourney. The king offering to furnish him with all thinges neceſſary, the Bishop anſwered, hee would not hazard his ſoule among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemyes of Gods Church. The king replying, hee therfore deſired to haue him along, beecauſe if his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience should bee any wayes endangered, the Bishop might reſcue and deliuer him; the Bishop ouercome with his importunity, happily yeelded: whereupon the king with a royal trayne ſett forward: neyther with any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or diſſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of his faythfull counſellors could hee be-recalled, but neuertheleſſe preceeded on with great iuſtice and religion, which purchaſſed him in all Countreyes where hee paſſed, both loue and reuerence: for though his company encreaſing amounted in showe to an army, yet would hee not ſuffer them to offer the leaſt wrong to any;<note place="margin">The ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar iuſtice of the king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</note> yea his ſeuere equity was ſuch, both at home and abroade, as when afterwardes vpon want of prouiſion for his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; complayning to the Emperour, hee deſired hee might
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:663:26"/> haue the ſame for money, and the Emperour willed that his ſeruantes as others who followed thoſe warres should gett it by spoyle of the Countrey: hee cryed out hee was no theife, nor would purchaſe by robbery, and although in eaſes of neceſsity this was tolerated, yet would hee not allow that in other nations, which hee condemned in his owne, or ſuffer his ſubiectes with forraine offences to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their domeſticall lawes. Wherupon the Germane Princes admyring, proteſted, that happy was the Realme where ſuch a king gouerned. But to returne to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe: After a tedious iourney approaching the Emperiall Campe, hee found contrary to his expectation a cold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynment. For Abſolon the good Bishop accompanyd with Rafe that ill Embaſſador, deliuered beefore the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the cauſe of his lords coming. But Frederike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning firſt the kinges neglecte and delay, ſayd, that hee who held his kingdome by ſeruice to the Emperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, forgot himſelfe much in omitting thus long his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. Abſolon anſwering, The Emperour should haue ſignifyd ſoe much to the king before hee vndertooke his iourney, and not to inuite him with ſuch faire and large promiſes. The Emperour wondering, anſwered, who fed the king with ſuch hopes and promiſes? Abſolon produced Rafe, ſaying, this is hee, who with your high promiſes abuſed the goodnes of our credulous king. But Rafe abashed at the Emperours denyall, gaue the Bishop leaue to vnfould the whole matter. The Emperour ſtill gayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying all, Abſolon deſired his kinge might haue then a ſafe conduct backe into his Countrey: But Fredericke yeelding to nothing, affirmed, that as hee medled not with his comming, ſoe hee would not aſsiſt him in his goeing. Heerupon the king repenting his rashnes, ſayd, allthough the ſwoard hung ouer his head, neuertheles hee would rather dye then inthrall his countrey to bondage. And for a remedy to this miſcheife, lying with the Emperour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:663:27"/> on the confines of France, determined by Abſolons coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, to flye thither by ſtealth for refuge. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour altering his mynde ſought to win him by giftes, whom hee could not bend by terror, and giuing the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sclauia allured the king to doe him Homage, yet ſoe as it should neyther preiudice his poſterity nor king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, alleadgeing for example the glorious king of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, who in like caſe for his principallityes in France, did Homage to the king of France. And now to deſcend to Octauians abſurd conuenticle, where the Archbishop of Clen declaymed of the iniury offered the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour by other kinges who would intermedle with choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Pope of Rome, where the Emperour on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide neuer interpoſed himſelfe about the elections of any Bishoppes in Cittyes ſubiect to their dominions. And the Emperour ſaying alſo that hee doubted not but the kinges there preſent, aſſembled by him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, would concurre with the Bishoppes in ratifying Octauians authority. When Octauian heereupon procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his counterfeit ſolemnity to accurſe Pope Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">The king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke by the aduiſe of Bishop Abſolon flyinge Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauian, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</note> the king of Denmarke admonished by Abſolon, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place, and refuſing to bee preſent at that ſacrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious excommunication, shewed thereby his approbation of Alexander, and reprobation of Octauian. And Bishop Abſolon following after, when Octauian requeſted him to ſtay, ſayd, there was no reaſon but as hee came with the king, ſoe hee should departe with him, and ſoe they both left Octauian. Thus the Emperour contrary to the Canons of the Church, ſummoned kinges to eſtablishe the Papacy.</p>

               <p>LEt vs now heere behould the Chriſtian world as at this tyme it preſented it ſelfe. Where firſt wee ſee the Pope &amp; Cardinals banished out of Rome, Italy and all, the mighty Emperour of Rome poſeſsing all theyr dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Eccleſiaſticall &amp; temporall, and mayntaineing Octauian that vſurping Scyſmatick in the Papal throne. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Conſtantinople not intermedling with the Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne Church, and alſo lately ouerthrowne by the Cecilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The king of Ieruſalem though acknowledging Alexander his lawfull Paſtor, yet raigning a far of, &amp; hardly able to defend the frontyers of Chriſtendome againſt the <hi>Saracens.</hi> The good king of Denmarke though lately showing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an approued Catholike, yet Frederickes Homager, and diuorced by all Germany from aſsiſting Pope Alexander. Bohemia drowned in Germany; and Hungary à remote
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:663:29"/> kingdome, and though ſubiect to the Romane Sea, yet not able to ſuccour her. The king of Cecill, though Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders faythfull freind, yet ſoe incumbred with domeſticall rebellions, as hee could not rayſe an army to reſtore him. The kingdomes of Spaine, though they wished him well, yet ſoe ouercome with the Mahomet a Moores as theyre ſtates were miſerable. So hee was only left by God to the pious &amp; worthie king of France, the powerfull king of England, and in myne opinion, the greateſt king of the Norman race that euer ſwayd ouer this land: for (as Gilbert B. of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don writing in the names of all the English Bishops to ſaint Thomas Archbishop of Canterbury, ſayth) his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions reached from the Perinean Mountaines to the Northerne ſeas; and if Edward the III. Henry the V. and Edward the IV. hauing England, Ireland, Callis, &amp; rather a tumultuous tytle, then any peaceable countreyes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable reuenues in France, were able to tryumph ouer France, then how much was Henry the II. who beeſides England &amp; Ireland, had the Dutchyes of Normandy &amp; &amp; Aquitaine, with the Earledome of Anioue his natiue ſoyle &amp; other honores in quiet poſseſsion, to omitt Britaine that had a great dependance on him, able to ouermatch the puiſſance of France. To paſſe from this to his great reuerence &amp; affection to Pope Alexander, I know no king that euer showed more: and laſt to aſcend to his actions, the effectes of theſe, Henry the II. drewe England, France, Spaine, Ireland &amp; Norwaye to obey Pope Alexander: and when the Emperour would haue ſurpryſed at Mount Saon, the king of France, and thereby entralled the Pope &amp; Cardinalles, &amp; spoyled them of all, this renowned <hi>K.</hi> with his couragious army reſcued them. Now what a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible attempt was it of the enemy of Mankind to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe (if hee could) from the Pope ſuch a king, from the Church ſuch a child? But though the billowes of theſe ſeas were wonderfull, yet God was more maruaylous in guiding ſainct Peeters ship through them. Conſidering all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:663:30"/> theſe, euery indifferent man may in reading this Epiſtolary hiſtory iudge how great reaſon the Pope had, as far as in conſcience hee poſsibly could, to forbeare this king ſoe well deſeruing of the Apoſtolike Sea. And alſo when, inforced through iuſtice thereunto, hee would haue executed againſt him the cenſures of the Church, what a true heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous acte it was to prefer the loue &amp; duty hee bore to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, before the fauor of ſoe great, &amp; ſuch a deſeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freind. And what aboue all others is moſt to bee marked in the proces of this matter, although all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of this realme fearefully &amp; fowly wandred aſtray, yea although ſaint Thomas of Canterbury himſelfe like an other ſaint Peeter falling, recouered againe, &amp; roſe to a glorious Martyrdome: yet Pope Alexander, whom it chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely concerned, neuer erred eyther infayth or infacte; God ſo directed with his holy Ghoſt the gouernor of his Church. Laſtly to conclude with this famous kinge, whoſe faire aryſing ſunne was ſoe ouerclowded with his turbulent paſsions, as they, moleſted the whole Church, and gaue occaſion (though, vnwitting to him) of the Martyrdome of the glorious Saint; hee returned neuertheles in the end ſoe clearly againe to himſelfe, as hee gaue that great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; indured, yea impoſed vpon himſelfe ſoe sharpe a pennance as was able to make his very enemys relent, and a ſtony hearte with teares to pitty him: Neither doe <hi>I</hi> thinke but the prayers &amp; merites of S. Thomas, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting his bloudy executioners to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trite penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes through Chriſtes paſsion ſaued their ſoules, did in like ſorte, yea more effectually helpe to raiſe to the ſame eternall bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes this king, after hee departed this world in the Octaues of S.

This being deliuered by Card. Bar. out of Roger I haue preciſely ſet downe, becauſe it is Cronicled that the king dyed out of charity, beeing I thinke as falſe, as that Pope Adrian (according to the Scyſmatickes fable) was choaked with a flye, or K.

               <hi>Your Brotherhood vnderſtandeth how wee haue, heard and by the reporte of ſome bin certifyed, that in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a certaine offence, you haue determined to forbeare the celebration of Maſſe, and abstayne from the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body and blood of our lord Which truly of what importance it is, especially in a man of your eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and how great a ſcandal may enſue thereupon, I would haue you with carefull conſideration to ponder, and weigh the ſame with your watchfull diſcretion. For you ought with prudence diligently to conceaue, that there is very great difference, where ſinnes are wilfully committed with deliberation: and where on the other ſide they are donne out of ignorance, or neceſsity: For it is apparant that wee ought to proceed in one ſorte with theſe which are acted by a mans owne free will: and in an other manner with thoſe which (as it is ſayd) are of ignorance, or the compulſion of neceſsity: and one way the firſt, an other way the laſt are by men of iudgment and wiſedome to bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and meaſured, as by the teſtimonyes of holy Scriptures wee are taught. Your intention giueth the name to your

If therefore you call to minde, that you haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted anything, whereof your owne conſcience ought to accuſe you, whatſoeuer it is, wee aduiſe you to confeſſe it in the Sacrament of Pennance, to a Preiſt of diſcretion and prudence, which beeing performed, our mercifull Lord, who looketh much more to the harte then to the facte, will through the commiſeration of his accuſtomed pitty, forgiue it you: and wee, beeing confident of the meritts of S.

            <p>Reader, you beehould Pope Alexander beeſett with extremityes, either to looſe the kinges good will, or grante his requeſtes, and yeeld to him who laboureth to extorte a petition againſt the Churches liberty: theſe two ſoe intangleing him, the one of the kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes hee ſatisfyed, giuing the Legantine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Bishop of Yorke the other hee abſolutely denyed, beeing the confirmation of the recited cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes; yea to the end this Legantine power, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Bishop of Yorke, might no way preiudice S. Thomas, hee thought good ſoe to reſtrayne the ſame in his later letters, that hee should vnderſtand this Legation of his for England, to bee confined with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that notwithſtanding hee should haue no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority graunted him ouer the Archbishop or Dioces of the Church of Canterbury.<note place="margin">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:663:46"/> wee omitt, thinking it ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if wee leaue them heere, noted with their numbres, in the margent. It is alſoo apparant in the ſame letters of Pope Alexander, that hee ſoe gaue the legation for England to the Bishop of Yorke, as neuertheleſſe hee would not ſuffer the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps to bee exempted from the obedience they owed vnto the Archbishop of Canterbury, to whom in very true right they were ſubiecte; which rather enkindled the Kinges greater indignation, who deſired the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Legantine authority for the Archbishop of Yorke, of purpoſe to depoſe the Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury.</p>
            <p>For Alexander hereupon inclined more to the cauſe of Sainct Thomas,<note place="margin">The Pope endeauoreth to ſuccour <hi>S.</hi> Thomas.</note> and was ſoe far of from graunting to pleaſure the King againſt him, as hee moſt carefully watched to ſupporte his proſperity, with the libertys of his Church, commanding alſo the principall Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of France, to pray for him vnto allmighty God, which is witneſſed by a meſſinger ſent from S.

               <hi>Becauſe the dayes are euill, and many thinges are to bee ſuffered, in regard of the quality of the time, wee entreate, aduiſe, counſell, and perſwad your diſcretion, that in all actions, as well of your owne, as thoſe appertaining to the Church, you beehaue your ſelfe warely, prouidently and circumspectly, and that you doe nothing haſtely or rashly, but all thinges deliberately and grauely: whereby you may recouer the fauour and goodwill of the renowned King of England, as much as poſsibly you may, without deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the liberty of the Church, and the honor of your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and authoritye: And that by all meanes you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and labour to endure the violence of the ſame King, vntill the next Eaſter, in ſuch ſorte, as you deuiſe not, to put any thing in execution againſt him or his land, vntill that perfixed tyme: for then our lord will graunt à better and milder ſeaſon, whereby as well you, as wee, may more ſafely and ſecurely proceede in our affaires.</hi> Thus Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander to Thomas; of whom (as wee haue ſayd) it is extant, that hee did write other letters, to the ſame effect vnto him.

My lord of Canterbury calling together ſome of his brethren of Canterbury Church, declared to them what had beefallen him, and how as yet it was not Godes pleaſure he should departe, and beeing refreshed with a light ſupper, reſted. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning came the kinges officers to confiſcate the whole eſtate of the Archbishop as a fugitiue; but hearing and ſeeing hee was preſent, confounded they helde theire peace.</p>

The tyme being come, they who were ſummoned, aſſembled, and a Parliament beeing helde at North-Hamptonne, my lord is called to anſwer his cauſe. The Archbishop together with the reſt of the Bishops, beeing ſate and ſequeſtred in a roome a parte, the dores, by the Kings commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, beeing shutt, ſo as there could be no paſſage forth; it was on his Majeſties beehalfe alleaged againſt him, that in the tyme of his Chancellorship, hauing many vacancyes of Bishopprickes, and Abbeys, with great rentes, for very many yeeres, in his handes, hee neuer gaue vp his accompt for the ſame, which now the kinge required of him. Heereunto ſayd the Archbis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop: wee will conſult with our counſell, and anſwer by aduice.</p>
            <p>While, therefore,<note place="margin">The opinions of the Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppes.</note> they remayned all in deepe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Gilbert Bishop of London, Deane of the Church of Canterbury, and in that reſpecte, cheefeſt of his Councell in authority, next vnder the Archbishop, my lord of Canterbury requiring him to ſpeake, ſayd: if (father) you conſider, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the king hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, what hee hath beeſtowed on you, and weygh alſoe the malice of theſe tymes, how miſerable a reigne you haue prepared for the Catholike Church, and vs, by withſtandinge the kinge heerein; you ought not only to yeelde him the Archbishoppricke of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, but alſo the ſame, were it tenne tymes better. And if perchance hee could but ſeein you that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hee would reſtore you whatſoeuer you haue loſt. Wee ſufficiently perceaue (quoth my lord of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury) what you haue aduiſedly anſwered.</p>
            <p>Then Henry Bishop of Wincheſter ſayd. This manner of Counſell, beeing abſolutely pernicious to the Catholicke Church, byndeth and confoundeth vs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:663:51"/> all: becauſe if our Archbishop and Primate of England should leaue vs ſuch an example, as that euery Bishop should yeelde and forſake at the becke and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Prince, his authority a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d care ouer the ſoules committed to his charge, what will bee then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ſtate of the Churches, but only this, that nothing will bee ordered according to law, but all will be confounded as the king liſteth, and ſuch as the Preiſt, ſuch will bee the people.</p>
            <p>Next Hilary Bishop of Chicheſter, a man glorious in wordes, adding his opinion, ſayd: if this inſtant time, and the troubles of the Catholike Church, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at our handes an other courſe, wee ought doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, to aſſent to your ſentence: But when the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Cannons ſtaggereth, wee ought very much to withdrawe the rigor of ſeuerity, that ſweete diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may profit there, where sharpe correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſtroy; wherefore I thinke wee ought to yeeld to the kinges pleaſure, yet only but for a tyme; leaſt otherwiſe wee run on rashly to decree that, whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon may followe a more greeuous retractation not without confuſion.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes the Bishop of Lincolne, a man truly ſimple, and of leſſe diſcretion, ſayd: it is apparant they ſeeke the life and blood of this man, and of neceſſity one of theſe muſt followe, that hee muſt ſuffer eyther in his Archbishoppricke, or in his life; now what fruite hee can reape of his Archbishoppricke, if hee loſeth his life therefore, I ſee not.</p>
            <p>But Bartholomewe Bishop of Exceſter ſpoake thus: it is playne that theſe dayes are euill; wherefore if wee may vnder the shadowe of diſſimulation, auoyd the force of this tempeſt without hurte or loſſe, it were eſpecially to bee procured: neither can wee eaſily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne thereunto, vnleſſe there bee a great relaxation of ſeuerity; the inſtance of this tyme requireth it,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:663:51"/> cheefely ſince this perſecution is not generall, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. It is better therefore, one head should in parte bee ſubiect to danger, then the whole Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland expoſed to an ineuitable perill.</p>
            <p>Roger the Bishop of Worceſter, beeing alſo asked his opinion, ſoe tempered his anſwer, as in his very negatiue, hee made apparant what his minde was. In this (quoth hee) I will giue no aduice, becauſe, if I shall ſay, that wee ought to leaue the care of ſoules receaued by vs from God, at the threatening and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a king, my mouth should declare againſte my conſcience, to the condemnation of my ſoule: if on the other ſide I cenſure, that the king in this caſe ought to bee reſiſted, Loe heere his followers will heare mee by whoſe relation, his Maieſtie will bee thereof certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, and I shall preſently bee caſt out of the Sinagoge, and hereafter ranked with his publicke and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned enemyes: wherefore I neither ſay this, nor counſell that.</p>

Wee haue conſulted about thoſe matters, for which my lord the king aſſembled vs heere, and in regarde wee haue not with vs now, thoſe perſons, who more cleerely vnderſtand this cauſe, wee therefore craue reſpite vntill to morrowe, determining to anſwer then as our lord shall inſpire vs. The Bishoppes of London and Rocheſter were ſent to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:663:52"/> deliuer this meſſage to the king; but London, like a crafty fox, corrupted the buſines, commended to his charge; telling the kinge; that my lord of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beeſought only at his Maieſties handes a truce of time, for making ready the wrytinges, as one prepared at the determined day to yeelde accompt in anſwer of his accuſations, and this hee ſayde to the end my lord of Canterbury, might bee thereby the more ingaged to fullfill the kinges requeſt.

With more iuſtice (anſwered Canterbury) the cariage heereof beelongeth to mee, vnder whoſe protection I remayne more ſecurely: and that Banner appearing, there is no doubt vnder what Prince I fight. London replyed: if the king ſeeth you entring in armes, hee will drawe his ſwoard, beeing of greater force, then yours, and ſtrike at your heade, and then you shall trye, what theſe your armes will auayle you.

At the laſte are the Bishops called into the kinges counſell, Canterbury beeing left to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter. The tyme is protracted, while they ſifte out the matter, for condemning the innocent. Canterbury with a confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t looke put on Conſtancy. Roger Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Yorke comming forth, ſayd to his Clearkes preſent (beeing Maſter Robert ſurnamed Croſſe, and Osbern a Rondell) let vs departe hence, wee ought not to beehould, what will here bee inſtantly executed on Canterbury.

The Archbishop of Yorke departing thus, Barthelmewe Bishop of Exceſter, comming out

            <p>The Archbishop therefore fixing his eyes on Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſaid: flie hence, becauſe you relish not, what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth to God: then iſſued out from the counſell all the Bishops together, in a troubled diſorder to Canterbury, where one among the reſt, I meane the Bishop of Chicheſter, breaking forth in theſe ruffling wordes, ſayd: Sometimes you were our Archbishop, and wee bounde to obey you: but becauſe you haue ſworne to our lord the king your fidelity, which is with your power to conſerue his life, limmes, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignity, keeping withall the cuſtomes required by him: and neuertheleſſe doe now, endeuour to deſtroy them which tend to his worldly royalty and honor wee therefore pronounce you guilty of periury, and as a periured Archbishop, wee are no longer oblyged to obey you: in reguard whereof committing and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting vs and ours to our lord the Popes protection, wee appeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you vnto his preſence, there to anſwer theſe obiections.

But in the the tyme of my promotion, while the Election was made; Prince Henry his ſonne (on whom this charge was impoſed) beeing there preſent, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, in what manner they would giue mee to the Church of Canterbury? Whereunto was anſwered: Free and diſcharged from all bandes of the Courte. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free and diſcharged: concerning theſe, from which I am diſcharged, neyther am I bounde, nor yet will I heereafter anſwer. This caſe is otherwiſe (ſayd the Earle) then the Bishop of London informed the king. Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury added: Withall marke this (ſonne Earle) how much the ſoule excelleth the body, ſoe much are you bound to obey God, and mee, beefore an earthly king; neyther yet law nor reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allowes, that children should iudge or condemne theyre father: where vpon I diſclay me from the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the king, of you, and others, beeing only to bee iudged, next vnder God, by our lord the Pope, vnto whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,

            <p>As hee went away, the courtyers and malitious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, crying out againſt him with reproches and iniuryes, and deprauing called him traytor. Comming to the vttermoſt gate, hee founde it shutt, nor could hee paſſe, no Porter beeing there to bee ſeene; and while the matter was handled in feare and hazard, as God would haue it, a bunch of keyes hung by the wall, which one of my Lord of Canterbury's followers, catching, tryed one after an other, vntil in the end hee opened the gate. Thus going forth, a great number who were ſicke of the Kinges euill, together with the poore, and impotent, mett him, reioycing and ſaying: Bleſſed bee our lord who hath deliuered, and reſcued his ſeruant, from the face and fury of his enemyes. For it was credibly ſuppoſed, hee had bin now deade.<note place="margin">S.

Suffer the poore of Chriſt, and partakers of our tribulation, to enter with vs, that wee may feaſt all together, in our Lord; and ſoe the whole houſe and courte were filled with theſe his gueſtes.

I aſcended into the fould of Chriſt, but not by the true dore, as a perſon not called by Cannonicall election but intruded by the terror of publick authority; and although I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke this burden againſt my minde, neuertheleſſe the will of man, and not of God induced mee thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

When Frederick the Emperour ſeeing the proſperitie of the Catholicke Pope Alexander, daily more and more to encreaſe, and that his holines was now pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable ſetled in Rome, beeing enraged with anger and enuie, commanded a Conuentickle in Witem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge (otherwiſe called Herbolis) at the feaſt of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoſt, where hee meant with his Bishops and Princes to aſſemble for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming the power of this Antipope Guido. Wherefore the king of England beeing by the Emperour inuited to this ſcyſme, beecauſe experience taught him that Pope Alexander inclined to the parte of ſaint Thomas, taking aduantage of this fit oportunitie for his excuſe, ſent an ambaſſage vnto the Citty to Pope Alexander, determining if hee refuſed to yeeld to his demands, then to fall off from him to Guido; for the better accomplishment whereof, hee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:663:75"/> wrote theſe letters to the Archbishop of Colen (the cheife ring-leader of the ſcyſmatickes) for procurring a ſafe conduct for his Embaſſadours.</p>
               <p>I <hi>haue long ſince deſired to find out ſome iuſt occaſion for leauing the parte of Pope Alexander and his vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cardinalls, whoe preſume to maintaine that Traytor Thomas, ſometimes Archbishop of Canterbury, againſt mee: whereupon by the aduice of all my Barons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Clergie, intending now to ſend to Rome men of great accompt in my kingdome, namely the Archbishop of Yorke, the Bishop of London, the Archdeacon of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Iohn of Oxenford, and Richard de Lucy, who openly and manifeſtly on the beehalfe of my ſelfe and my whole kingdome, with all other landes vnder my dominion, shall propound and denounce to Pope Alexander and his Cardinalls, that they shall no longer defend my Traytor, but ſoe abſolutely diſcharge and free mee of him, as</hi> I, <hi>with the counſail of my Clergie, may eſtablish an other in the Church of Canterburie; and shall moreouer require that they reuoke and make voyd whatſoeuer Thomas hath done, and likewiſe demand that the Pope in their, preſence cauſe it to bee ſworne publickly, that hee and his ſucceſſors shall conſerue for euer (as far as to them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth) to mee, and all my ſucceſſors, the royall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of Henry my grandfather inuiolable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, and if by chance they will gainſay any one of my demandes, that then neither I, nor my Barons, nor yet my Clergie will euer heereafter yeeld him any obedience; yea wee will openly withſtand him and his, and whoſoeuer vnder my gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shall bee found heereafter to follow his parte, shall bee banished out of my kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I entreate you as my deareſt frend, all excuſes ſet aparte to ſend mee speedily brother Ernold or brother Randulph of the hospitall of ſaint Iohn, whon may on the beehalfe of the Emperour and your ſelfe giue ſafe conduct
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:663:75"/> to the afore ſaid Embaſſadors as well in their goeing as returne through the Emperour's dominion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the kinges letter. An Embaſſage was alſo ſent to Pope Alexander, which London and Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford only executed. But ſoe far was Pope Alexander from beeing any way moued, either by the terrors of the kinges thundering letters, or other threates vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Embaſſadors in the kinges name, as hauinge rebuked their rashnes, hee returned to the king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe an anſwer fraughte with sharpe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, wherewith beeing terrifyd hee deſiſted from his wicked intention, and gaue therfore great thankes to his Holines, promiſing heereafter to obey euer readily in all thinges; whereof the Bishops of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland in their epiſtle ſent the next yeere to Pope Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander, are apparant witneſſes; which afterwards in place conuenient wee determine to declare. Meane while (ſayth our Author) Colen requireth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors aduiſe, in what ſorte hee should a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwer the king of England; whereunto the Emperor replyeth, that hee ought to ſatisfy the kinges deſire; in reguard with how much the more ſolemnity this matter is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, ſoe much the greater shall bee the Popes confuſſion, if hee condeſcendeth to the kinges re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and it may bee that ſecretly by ſome one of the Temple or Hoſpital or any other (whom they could not preuent) the king by corruption of money may otherwiſe obtayne the ſame. Wherefore brother Randolph of the Hoſpitall was addreſſed to the king of England, who ſafely conducted the Embaſſadors whom the king intended to ſend to the courte of his Holines through the Emperors dominion.</p>
               <p>Thus much there. But ſoe it beefell that the ſame Embaſſadors came firſt into Germany, where they were preſent at the Conuentickle of Witemberge; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:663:76"/> what matters were there handled the letters patents of Fredericke the Emperor, dated at that place, declare where among other thinges is thus written of this Embaſſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreouer the honorable Embaſſadors of our renowned freind the king of England directed from him to vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cod. Vat. Epiſt <hi>70.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>did on the beehalfe of the ſame king in the preſence of the whole court, vpon the reliques of Saintes, make their publicke oath to vs, that the king himſelfe together with all his kingdome should continew faithfull to our ſide, and ioyning with vs should euer defend the Lord Paſcall (whoſe parte wee take) and neuer heereafter intermedle in mayntaining Rowland the Schyſmaticke. Beccauſe alſo wee (who haue euer hitherto bin ready to abyde the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the vprighteouſnes of our cauſe, which the aduerſaries of the Church of God and vs, bee it either out of their pride, or the diſtruſt of their cauſe haue auoyded) are now by reaſon of their manifeſt obſtinacy, compelled to vnacuſtomed oathes: Let therefore, heereafter euery man and eſtate carefully eſchew the Communion of Scyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes; for their fury allthough it hath ſeemed hitherto in ſome ſorte pardonable, it will heereafter bee alltogether intollerable &amp;c.</hi> Moreouer in an other letter written by one affected to Pope Alexander is ſayd. <hi>That Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke the Emperor gloryeth in the aſsiſtance of the king of England, whoſe Embaſſadors were ſworne to the parte of the Antipope &amp;c.</hi> In an other place likwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fredericke Couloreth his buſines with falſe propheſies, that Pope Alexander should bee taken captiue; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to not only the vulgar ſorte, but the king of England, expecting the euent, hath allmoſt giuen credit &amp;c.</hi> And out of Salisbury: The king of England is confident in the Emperor, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the captiuity of my Lord the Pope, which the Prophetts of Belial haue tould him.</p>
               <p>But whereas the kinges Embaſſadors did ſweare in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:663:76"/> his Maieſties name to followe the Scyſmaticall factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Arch-bishop of Roane excuſeth the ſame, as no way done by the kinges commandement, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in his letters directed to Henry Preiſt and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of the title of the Saintes Mereus and Achilleus, written thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the king of England, wee certainly ſecure you, that neither by himſelfe, nor by his Embaſſadors hee euer gaue oath or promiſe to leaue the Church and cleaue to the Schyſmaticke; yea wee are aſſured that in thoſe couenants of Maryage (whatſoeuer they were) all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for three dayes the Almaynes indeauoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert him, hee would neuer accord to any thing, but with preſeruation of his fidelity to our Lord the Pope, the Church, and the king of France; and as well our lady the Empreſſe, as our ſelues, haue by our letters inioyned him to cleere himſelfe with all expedition, from this asperſion. For our partes, beeing at Roan, allthough the kinges Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were then alſo there, wee only heard of them, but ſawe them not, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for theſe Embaſſadors who faulted ſoe fouly, wee find that ſainct Thomas excommunicated them, as his letters to his ſuffraganes in the yeere following doe ſignify, which heere after in their turne wee will declare.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges beeing thus layd open concerninge this paſſage with Fredericke the Emperour againſt Pope Alexander, it remayneth that wee likwiſe know what were the actions of this yeere, concerning ſaint Thomas Archbishop of Canterbury.

Who doubteth the Church of Rome to be the head of all Churches, and fountayne of Catholicke doctrine? Who is ignorant that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen were deliuered to Peeter? Doth not the frame of the whole Church aryſe on the fayth and Doctrine of Peeter, vntill wee doe all meete beefore Chriſt in a perfect man, in the vnity of fayth, and acknowledgment of the ſonne of God? (And afterwardes.) But whoſoeuer hee bee that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth or planteth, God giueth encreaſe to none, but him, who hath planted on the fayth of Peeter, and humbleth himſelfe vnto his doctrine. To him truly are referred the iudgmentes of the people which are of greateſt importance, to bee examined by the Pope of Rome, and the Magiſtrates ſubordinate to him in the Courtes of the Church, that they who are aſsiſtantes in partaking the care, may excerciſe the power committed to their charge; ſoe as the preiſt when hee cannot determine a matter incident to the flocke of his parish, may referre the ſame to his Bishop, who ſubmitteth things ſurmounting his reach alſo to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop or Metropolitane, from whom whatſoeuer is of greateſt importance, is reſerued vnto the high Bishop of Rome. This order hath Peeter taught vs, and the ſame hath the Catholicke Church obſerued vnto this day, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Gods grace shall is euer bee ouerthrowne what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer iniquity attempteth againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſs in the kingdome of England (which I cannot without exceeding greefe recall to mynd, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teares declare) they preſume wonderfully againſt Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The authority of the Apoſtolicke Sea (as much as
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:663:87"/> lyeth in peruerſe Potentates) is extenuated and indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whyle they who of neceſsity are compelled for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their pennance or procuring the commodity of their ſoules, or otherwiſe in the duty of viſitation to trauell ouer to our Lord the Pope, are hindred in their iourney, ſpoyled, hardly handled, and forbidden to paſſe the ſeas either by thoſe who ſeeke out occaſions to committ miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefes, or by others who are compelled to take oathes for reſtrayning Clearkes and Penitents in this ſayd iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And therefore in regard they lay violent handes on the Clergie, they incurre by their owne acte the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of accurſing; which is the reaſon that wee vſing the authority of the Church of Rome, doe command your brotherhood, charging yee by the Apoſtolicke power in the vertue of obedience, and vpon the perill and hazard of your order that yee denounce them publickly excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and cauſe them ſoe to bee declared through out your Dioceſes, who lay violent handes on the Clergie: and that yee command your neighbouring Bishoppes by the authority of our Lord the Pope and alſo of vs to performe the ſame likewiſe in thier Bishopprickes.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer in the ſame manner, and vnder the ſame payne wee command yee to denounce to ſuch as hinder Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellantes or Penitents from trauailing to our Lord the Pope or vs, that they incurre the ſentence of accurſing, as well as they who doe it in proper perſon, as alſo the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges officers who conſtrayne others to this heynous offence. And for ſuch as beeing enforced thereunto, haue taken vnlawfull oathes to hinder theſe aforeſayd paſſengers, wee abſolue them from their oathes, whereby they may heereafter deſiſt from ſoe greate à ſinne, and beeing penitent for their offence, learne rather to obey God then man. If any one in ſeeking to right his Church, and conſerue the integrity of his faith to the Apoſtolicke Sea, dreadeth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcommodityes, let him remember how the Church
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:663:88"/> with far more ſafety and profitt purchaſeth vertue, then temporall treaſures, and that Chriſt who raigneth ouer the Church of Rome reſtrayneth the powers of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryes, and hee who shall punish the mighty mightely, will chaſtiſe likewiſe all diſobedience, not only bringing the poore to iugdment, but alſo humbling the glorious of this world to the miniſtry of the Church, againſt which the very gates of hell shall not preuayle.</p>
                     <p>Bee ashamed (moſt deerely beeloued) to put in practiſe vniuſt iudgmentes, in ſuch ſorte as the peeres of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome inſulting vpbrayd yee ſaying: If a poore man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth a light offence, hee is preſently excommunicated by yee and your officers, but if a rich perſon tranſgreſſeth, hee is not ſo much as with a word chaſtiſed; whereby ſcandalls may on euery ſyde bee retorted on ſuch iudges. And can greate powers againſt the poore ſoe rage? Looke therefore to your ſelues and your Churches, leaſt if yee diſſemble the iniuryes of the Romane Church, yee may bee iuſtly thought to conspire with the impious againſt her, and to haue foreſtalled the wayes of thoſe who wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that yee might raiſe your commodityes vpon the Churches loſſe. Remember rather how our fathers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiued ſaluation; by what meanes, and how great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations the Church hath encreaſed, and bin dilated, what huge ſtormes the ship of Peeter hath eſcaped, hauing Chriſt for her Pilot.</p>

It is better to bee highly commended for vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary pouerty, then bee openly taxed by all men of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for a receaued benefitt. It is deepely rooted in the mynds of all how gratious our Lord the king hath bin vnto you, vnto how greate dignity hee hath rayſed you
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:663:98"/> from poore degree, and receaued you into the boſome of his fauor with a mynd ſoe free, as the ample boundes of his dominion reaching from the Northerne Ocean to the Pire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Mountaynes were by him ſoe abſolutely ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your power, as through all thoſe principalityes they were only accompted happy, who could finde but fauor in your ſight, and that no worldly mutability might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe your prosperity, hee would lay your foundation moſt aſſuredly in poſſeſsion appertayning to God, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his mother diſſwaded, the realme cryd out againſt it, and the Church of God (as far as shee could) ſighed and groaned thereat, hee endeauored by all meanes poſsible to rayſe you alofte vnto the dignity of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent preferment, hoping hee should heereafter raigne bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, and enioy your aſsiſtance and counſell with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſecurity. If therefore where hee expected ſecurity to defend him, hee shall find a ſword to offend him, what a rumor will bee ſpread of you in the mouthes of all men? what a reward, what a remembrance will this bee of a requitall neuer heard of beefore? Forbeare therefore (if ſo it liketh you) to wrong your fame, forbeare to iniure your renowne: and endeauor to ouercome with humility your king, with charity your ſonne. Whereunto if our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions cannot moue you, the loue and fidelity you beare to his Holines and the ſacred Roman Church ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyne you: For you ought eaſily to bee perſwaded not to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt any thing, whereby to encreaſe the labours of your Mother, who hath bin now long in troubles; that her greife, which allready lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth the diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of many her vndutifull children, bee not encreaſed by the loſſe of thoſe who remayne as yet obedient. For what if ſoe by theſe your bitter prouocations and endeauors (which God forbid) our king, whom through the Allmightys bounty, people and kingdomes doe attend, should reuolt from our Lord the Pope, and refuſe perchance heereafter to followe his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:663:99"/> Holines. Who denyeth him aſsiſtance againſt your ſelfe? wherein, with what petitions, what giftes, with how many and how great promiſes hath hee bin ſolicited? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas hee hath remayned hitherto firmly grounded on the rocke, and as a Conqueror in the heyght of his magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty contemned all the world could offer, one only feare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth as yet, leaſt hee; whom neither profered riches, nor all that in humaine glory is accompted pretious, could euer once moue, should in the end by the only indignation of his mynd bee ouerthrowne: which if by your default it should ſoe fall out, you could neuer after with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon forbeare to waſte your ſelfe wholy in the Threanes of Ieremy, or deny your eyes a fountaine of teares.</p>
                     <p>Recall therefore (if ſoe it pleaſeth your excellency) this counſell, which if it proceedeth, will by all meanes bee truly pernicious to our Lord the Pope, the ſacred Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, and (if it liketh you to vnderſtand it) alſoe to your ſelfe. But they about you, who mount higheſt in their owne conceiptes, will not ſuffer you parchance to proceede on this way; they exhorte you to make tryall what you are able to doe againſt our Lord the king, and to practiſe the power of your eminent authority againſt all that lyeth within the compaſſe of his Dominion. A power truly terrible to an offendor, and dreadfull to him who refuſeth to ſatisfy; but for our Lord the kinge, wee will not ſay hee neuer offended, but that hee, was, and is euer ready to yeelde ſatisfaction to the Popes Holines, wee confidently affirme and pronounce.

Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly if hee were aduyſed, hee would turne the fury of his indignation againſt them, who with their guiles and abuſes, haue thruſt him headlong into this not counſell but downefull; and would at the leaſt imitate the king of Babilon, that hee might not bee found more cruell then hee, who caſt them into the Lyons denne, by whoſe counſell hee threw Daniel a priſoner thither, that the guilty counſellers might ſuffer the paynes, they deuiſed againſt the guiltles.</hi> Then addeth hee examples of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppes reſtored by kinges to theire proper Seas; wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus: [The Archbishop of Saint Iames who liued long in banishment, is now reſtored by his king, The king of the Danes calling home his Archbishop, gouerneth by his aduice, ſubdueth his enemyes, and honoreth him as his father: The Archbishop of Lyons hath receaued againe his Sea, and reduced his prouince to the Catholike vnity: The cittyes of Italy abandoning Fredericke the Scyſmaticke, haue enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned their Catholicke Bishoppes: God is my witnes, vnles our Lord and king recalleth againe his Archbishop, I dread to vtter the feare I conceaue of him; but if hee will ſend for him, and render peace to the Church of God, I doe aſſuredly hope, that in him and his the glory of his former ſucceſſes will through the Churches prayers flourish againe; what ſay I more?
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:663:111"/> There reſteth, yet for him one apparant aduice, which is, that hee banisheth his wicked counſellors, the Churches aduerſarys, and endeauoreth to appeaſe All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, whom hee hath offended, againſt whoſe diuine pleaſure hee can neither raigne nor rule. God hath yet endured him with vnſpeakeable patience, but vnleſſe hee beeware, as the woeman in labor, hee will shortly ſpeake againſt his immoderate procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges] And thus far Iohn for this yeere, but after this enſued a wonderfull mutation of matters.</p>
               <p>For in the meane tyme the king of England, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledde with moſt wicked connſell, that hee might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the ſentence of Excommunication, thus thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atening him, ſearcheth out new remedys, inuenting other ſutle and more potent deuices, which was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe an other embaſſage, and ſend an other Sinon to Rome to deceaue Alexander with vntrue oathes, and corrupt (as hee could) the Cardinals with money. To ſet this ſinne abroach, is choſen the worſt of men, periured, excommunicated, Iohn of Oxeforde, the vſurper of a Deanry, (as beefore is mentioned) who furnished with lyes, and falſe promiſes, and alſo with gould, might ouerthrowe the whole iudgment, and recall Pope Alexander from pronouncing his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of excommunication and interdiction, beeguy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him with pretended promiſes of peace, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute reſtitution of all the Churches priuiledges inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the king.

But allthough Pope Alexander proceeded thus warely in ſending his Legates, notwithſtanding this (which might ſeeme ſoe paſſing commendable) by reaſon of the falſe reportes forerunning the Legates, appeared to the credulous, as a matter not beeſeeminge ſuch a ſingular Pope: in ſoe much as all, as well by wordes as wrytinges exclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt him, yea his very freindes, and thoſe moſt forward for the Catholicke cauſe; but how vniuſtly, will bee eaſily perceaued by this Popes letters which shall heereafter bee recyted; yet how, beefore this was throughly vnderſtood, the tongues of men, yea of the wiſe, were let looſe againſt him, you shall ſee by what next enſueth, and thereby learne how euery one, yea though moſt holy, is ſett vp as a marke, and as well his freinds as foes will ſometymes shoote at him the arrowes of detraction.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:663:113"/> beeing then alſo at the pointe of paſſing the ſeas; and London peruſing the letters with reioyceing burſt out into theſe wordes: now Thomas from hence forth shall bee no more my Archbishop: And Iohn mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer added: that hee was a priuiledged perſon, nor could heereafter bee excommunicated, nor conuented by vs, but only in the preſence of our lord the Pope, and likewiſe had free power to beeſtowe the Deanry of the Church of Saliſbury, on whom hee liſted, and for our dignity, that it was in euery point diminished vntill the Legates comming: All this did the Bishop certify vs by his Chaplayne beeing a Cannon Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and a Religious man, whom hee ſent to excuſe his forbearance of comming to vs at our cyting; for wee cyted him once and agayne, and laſtly the third time, with a peremptory Mandate to appeare beefore vs, beetweene that, and the feaſt of the Purification, as a man of great authority, the kinges familiar, and one who should mediate a peace beetweene his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and us, if poſſibly it might bee compaſed. All this the Cannon is ready to teſtify by oath, that thus hee receaued the ſame from the mouth of the Bishop to bee deliuered on his beehalfe to vs. Which if it bee true, then doubtles our lord the Pope hath choaked and ſtrangled, not our perſon only, but alſoe himſelfe, with all the Clergy of both the kingdomes, yea verily both Churches as well of France as England; for ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with this moſt foule example, what will not other Princes of the world dare attempt againſt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall perſons? To whom shall they haue refuge? How can they hee confident of the Church of Rome, that hath ſoe forſaken and left deſtitute vs, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her cauſe with fighting therefore to the very death? What will beefall, if (theſe vnſpeakeable and deteſtable priuiledges ſtanding good, together with

All theſe would then deſcend on their heires, nor would euer heereafter bee wreſted out of their hands. And what is far worſe, other Princes ſtirred vp with this example would extorte the like priuiledges, to bring the Church, whether shee will or no into ſubiection: Soe shall the Churches whole liberty vtterly decay, together with the iuriſdiction and power of Bishoppes, no man remayning who is able to controule and reſtaine the outrages of Tyrants, whoſe whole intention is at this day bent to make hauocke of the Church and Clergy, nor will they haue brought them, like others into bondage. What will bee the end wee know not, but this wee knowe, that our greife exceedeth meaſure, bee theſe thinges true or falſe, which are thus propounded: For wee are neither obeyed nor reſpected in any thing, as wee were wont, by Bishoppes or Abbotts, or others of the Clergy of England, beeing now aſſured of our depoſition. But let our Lord the Pope bee perſwaded, that wee will neuer on any condition paſſe ouer into the kinges Dominion, to haue there our cauſe decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor will wee euer abide the iudgment of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and eſpecially of Papyan, who thirſteth nothing but our blood, thereby to obtayne our ſeate, which in truth (as wee heare) is allready promiſed him, vpon condition the king may bee deliuered of vs.</p>
               <p>Wee haue alſo an other exceeding greiuance.

In which peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theyrs, it is firſt a falshood, that (as it is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) the king requeſted onely a Legate for England, which was the Cardinall of Papia: For heare the ſame Saliſbury: Our king (ſaith hee) requireth that Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Papia, and another Cardinall bee ſent as Legates,

               <p>Moreouer that his Holines deſigned the ſame legates not to decyde the controuerſy (as it was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly reported) according to Iohn of Saliſburyes ſaying, but to compoſe a peace, the letters of the ſame Pope Alexander, yet extant, doe playnly witnes. But to the end ſaint Thomas might reſt ſecure of any feare from the ſayde William the Legate, Alexander aboue all other thinges made him promiſe not to attempt any matter againſt the Archbishop of Canterbury: I will relate the very wordes of Pope Alexander in his epiſtle to Saint Thomas: and truly (ſayth hee) you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne abſolutely confident in the Cardinalls. neyther ought you any way to doubt of the mentioned Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, becauſe wee haue ſtreyghtly and preciſely inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, to employ his whole power to worke your peace, and hee made vs ſoe faithfull a promiſe thereof, that wee haue no doubt of the contrary. And more, that hee might very much preuayle in procuring the peace, the matter beeing throughly conſidered, by reaſon of his intire familiarity with the king, the ſame Saliſbury conceaued in his mynde, and expreſſed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:663:118"/> in wryting to the Legate in theſe wordes: but in the meane tyme, I hope, this your familiarity with the king, which to many is ſoe ſuſpicious, will bee profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Church, neceſſary to you, gaynfull to him, and to vs glorious.</p>
               <p>Beeſides this Alexander endeauouring to make a peace beetweene the Archbishop and the king, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not (as the kings, meſſinger lying fouly ſayd) that this should bee accomplished with detriment to the Churches liberty, but contrarywiſe would haue aboue all thinges a ſpeciall prouiſion for the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall lawes; ſoe as in this pointe ſaint Thomas had no cauſe of doubt, that the liberty of the Church should heerein ſuſtaine any damage at all, as in the ſame letters the ſayd Bishop deliuered. Againe that there was nothing granted by Alexander to the Bishoppes excommunicated by ſaint Thomas (as Oxeford falſly affirmed) but that at the houre of death they might bee abſolued, with a caution confirmed by oath, as the letters which his Holines wrote by the ſame Legates to the Bishops of England doe manifeſt. Neither yet was that true which with exceſſiue boaſting Oxeforde did lying ſpread abroade among all men,<note place="margin">Cod. Vat. lib. <hi>2.</hi> epiſt. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> how the king was exempted from the Archbis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppes authority, but that his power ouer the king was only ſuſpended while the Legates treated as the peace, in like caſe and ſpace as there is beetweene ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe armys an abſtinence of warre during a parlee. And if peace tooke no place, that Saint Thomas might then vſe his authority againſt the king, Alexander in his letters ſent to S. Thomas thus playnly declareth: [But if perchance (which God forbid) the king shall determine with a hardened harte to perſiſt in his obſtinacy, nor yet will, as now, yeeld any thing to the will of Allmighty God; our admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and his owne honor in his reconciliation to

               <p>And to the pointe, that Pope Alexander dealte boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with Iohn of Oxeforde, the kinges meſſinger, at his comming to Rome, beeſtowing on him the Deanry of Salisbury, which beeing extorted from his Bishop, hee ſurrendred vp into te handes of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that done, the wretched and alltogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wortthie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, receaued the ſame from the Pope againe, For the Popes excuſe heerein, Iohn of Poytiers wryteth thus in his letters to ſaint Thomas: [Iohn of Oxeforde woon the more grace in the Popes ſight, in regard hee ſuggeſted to his Holines, that a peace might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded beetweene you and the king, if there were but one to deale faithfully in the buſines; and promiſed to doe his owne vttermoſt endeauor for the performance thereof.] And addeth, hee was abſolued from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication by the Pope, in reſpect hee abiured the kinges cuſtomes, the very ground of all this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcord.

And Pope Alexander wryting the next yeere to the Legates againſt this Iohn of Oxeforde, who had diſpercing ſowed ſuch falshoodes in the myndes of all, commanded him to bee punished with a moſt ſeuere iudgment. And theſe letters shall alſo in their proper place bee recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>All this haue wee ſayd to wash away the fowle ſlanders which Iohn of Oxeforde bruted in England againſt Pope Alexander, and which Iohn of Salisbury too credulous relished ſoe ill for a tyme: for although (as you haue ſeene) hee ſpoake hardly againſt Pope Alexander, yet afterwardes againe hee commendeth, and in parte excuſeth him, in regarde what hee did, was vpon conſtraint of neceſſity. For writing to ſaint Thomas hee ſayth: Neither haue I any greate confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Courte of Rome, whoſe manners and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitys are well knowne to vs: Pope Alexander in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is a holy and iuſt man, but his extremityes are ſoe many, and ſoe greate is the couetouſnes and wicked dealing of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as ſometymes hee ſtretcheth to the vtermoſt of his power, and procureth by diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that which is ſayd to bee profitable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, allthough vnprofitable to Religion.

But hee corrected abſolutely this and all the reſt of his laſt letters written vpon this occaſion, after better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of the buſines, handling the whole matter from the very firſt comming of this moſt vilde man Iohn of Oxeforde, and wryting to Myles Bishop of Moryn in this ſorte: If any man will dilligently conſider the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:663:119"/> preceedinges at Rome, hee shall apparantly ſee, how the Pope, albeeit circumuented, yet neuertheles moſt faythfully handled the cauſe of the Church and vs. For the often recyted Iohn of Oxeford beeing in the end vpon his oath according to the cuſtome abſolued, ſwoare againe publickly, that hee did nothing in the aforeſayd Conuentickle of Scyſmaticks, againſt the faith of the Church, and the honor and commodity, of my Lord the Pope; And I would to God hee had not bin periured. Afterwardes hee deliuered letters of commendation and Petition from the king, wherin was written, that credit should bee giuen to him in all thinges, as to the king himſelfe: Then boulſtred out with ſoe greate an authority, hee ſubmitteth the cauſe in controuerſy betweene the king and the Archbishop for the wicked cuſtomes, to the arbitriment of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, that at his pleaſure they should bee either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed or cancelled, and binding this alſo with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oath, hee preuayled ſoe farre, as the Pope yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſend his Legates to this purpoſe.] Thus ſayth Salisbury. whereby you may ſee, that a man promiſing ſoe much, and that not idely, but fortifyed with the letters of a king, and mayntayned with oathes, ought not to paſſe vnrewarded from the Pope; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde his Holines beeſtowed, as the ſame Author wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth in the Epiſtle next enſuing; for hee ſent him backe into England endowed with a Ring, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the benefice of a Deanry; whereupon hee grew to falſify with more confidence, and had far better oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to coulor his deceyptes, And I would to God I could excuſe as well as the Pope, ſome of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, who were corrupted with golde; but God forbid I should purge with excuſe that which deſerueth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding reprehenſion; yea I haue euer ſayde, theſe deade flyes looſing the odor of their oyntmentes, are

The king of England ought to returne againe vnto the homage of the king of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and taking a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and publicke oathe to profeſſe beefore all men, that for the Duchie of Normandy hee would ſerue him as his Lord in ſuch wiſe as the Dukes his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors were accuſtomed to ſerue the kinges of France. That hee was bound to reſigne the Countyes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioue and Cenomane, together with the fealty of the peeres depending on theſe Signiories to Henry his ſonne, who therupon was to doe homage and fealty to the king of France againſt all men, neither to owe any more to his father or brothers therfore, but what the conſideration of nature or meritt required. The king of France on the other ſyde did grant to Richard, ſonne to the king of England the Duchie of Aquitayne on like conditions, giuing him his daughter in mariage without any dowry, who was neuertheles at her fathers pleaſure to accept any free gifte towardes her mariage
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:663:129"/> Theſe were the conditions of peace eſtablshed at Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: but vpon new occaſions broke out a rupture of warre againe; whereupon it was neceſſary the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes after our Lordes Aſcention should once more bee reuiued, ſauing the king of France would not bee obliged to beeſtowe his daughter on Richard the king of Englands ſonne. Thus is it there related at large. And yet although Pope Alexander (as hath bin ſayde) admonished by letters his Legates who were ſent into France, that ſetting other buſines a parte, they should only bend their forces to reunite the kinges ſoe rent in warres; neuertheles one of the Legates William of Papia not performing (as it was beeſeeming) the office of a Mediator, far from indifferency, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth in affection to neither parte, beecame preſently an abſolute partaker with his frind Henry, king of England,<note place="margin">Vvilliam the Legate ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Did not (vpon the flight of the Paſtors as it is famouſely reported in Hiſtoryes) all Egipt returne to Idolatry, where at the firſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſo exceedingly flourished? Then running to an other matter, they demanded if wee would abyde the iudgment of the Legates in the controuerſy beetweene the king and vs, and that if heerin we refuſed iudgment wee ſeemed to iuſtify the kings ſyde, and in the eyes
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:663:139"/> of many to diminish the credit of our cauſe: wher on the other parte (if it ſtandeth with your pleaſure) wee are not bound to admitt our aduerſary for a iudge: neither can wee bee confident of any heerein but only in your preſence, for by reaſon of the baniſhment of vs and ours, the king ſoe frighteth and terrifyeth all men with the vexation and loſſes of others, as none, knowing it, dareth once affoarde vs a good word. Conſidering deepely all this, wee tempered our anſwer ſoe as wee neither refuſed nor accepted this iudgment and dangerous tryall: For wee ſayde, whenſoeuer wee, who were thus beerefte of Archbishoppricke, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all our goodes, were reſtored agayne to what wee lofte, wee would then gladly, and when wee ought ſubmitt our ſelues to your determination, or the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him or them, whom by your mandate you should appoint, nor could wee nor would wee flye from iuſtice; in the meane tyme wee could not with any reaſon bee conſtrayned to a contentious courſe of lawe, neither were our poore meanes able to ſupporte it, neither could the liberality of the moſt renowned king, without moleſtation, extend it ſelfe ſoe far as to mayntaine vs with the poore of Chriſt our banished breathren vpon his expence vnder the roofes of ſtrangers, eſpecially ſince hee aboundeth not at this inſtant with money; for where hee hath plenty of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls, there can he more tollerably defray our charges.</p>
               <p>Then deſcended they to the third queſtion, demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if wee would admitt the proces of the Bishoppes who appealed againſt vs beefore thoſe iudges: But wee anſwered, wee receaued no mandate of yours concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this buſines, nor yet that our pouerty was able to vndergoe the expences of ſuch a controuerſy: forth at was the drifte of our Aduerſſaryes (as wee vnderſtood by them who could not bee ignorant heerin) to giue a
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:663:139"/> taynte to our perſon vpon any occaſion in the preſence of the Legates, therby to worke vs any wrong. For they coniectured that none of the prouince durſt aſſiſt: vs againſt the king, in regarde wherof they might the ſooner procure our ruyne: and the king called out on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe to this conference, who beeing our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes from the firſt rayſing of this ſtorme, were knowne to bee the inuentors of ſoe greate a miſcheife, which were the Archbishop of Yorke with the Bishoppes of London and Chicheſter, the Bishop of Worceſter beeing alſo ſent for with them, that vnder the vayle of his worthines the malice of the reſt might bee sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed. But as your wiſedome may remember theſe who now ſoe applaude the kinges pleaſure, and aboue the reſt (as it is openly knowne) thirſt our bloud, are they who ſometymes ſoe much extolled in their letters full fraught with our prayſes, the procuring of our Pall, and the forme of our election together with our perſon; but now contradicting both truth, and themſelues, through an impudency of lying and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, they beecome contemptible, whilſt at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Prince, like the ſlaue in the Comedy, now they ſay, now they gayneſay: theſe are they (o father) who giue hornes to the ſinner, and if hee bee not made enough, incenſe him more, laying ſofte cushons vnder his elbowe, and lulling a ſleepe on daynty pillowes the heade that languisheth with ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Since therfore they who ought with their counſell, aſſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and authority to bee the pillars of the Church, doe now with their flattery and expences animate and arme the perſecutors of the diuine lawe and of our ſelues againſt her and vs, it is not ſafe nor poſſible for vs to ſubiect our ſelues to iudgment, but only in the preſence of your Holines, and to bee examined by your ſelfe: For although the Church may conceaue a great
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:663:140"/> hope of the ſinceare proceeding of one of the Legates, and wee are confident in him, eſpecially in matters appertayning to God, neuertheles there is not any man but your ſelfe to whom wee dare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt this cauſe of our Lordes; and for the other, God make him the man who may ſaue his ſoule and beeſeeme the place of a preiſt Cardinall of the Romane Church; yet let that neuer come to paſſe which (pleaſeth it you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) wee forewarned and feare will yet happen, if it should fortune, the wiſedome, eloquence and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Lord William should concurre with the power and willfull diſpoſition of the king of England, wee doubt (wee ſaye) they will demaunde of vs by their counſell and conſent thoſe thinges which either bee greeuous for you to heare and impoſſible to bee effected, or otherwiſe diſpleaſing to God and odious to the world.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the charge of all Churches reſteth on your shoulders, turne (if it pleaſe you) your eyes on the weſt, marke and ſee in what ſorte the Church, is there handled, let it bee tould by the lord Oddo, whom wee beeleiue the ſpirit of God guydeth, let him declare what hee behouldeth, what hee knoweth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church and Prouince of Towers, what hee heard reported in England, what hee hath by experience found in Normandy, and wee beeleiue you will ſay with teares, there is no greife like to the greife of this. For to let paſſe the Churches of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury and Towers which hee houldeth in his handes, as you haue heard, and wee wish you would heare it more fully, hee hath now of long tyme retayned to himſelfe ſeauen vacant Bishopprickes in the prouinces beelon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to vs and Roan, nor ſuffereth any paſtors to bee ordayned in them, the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is giuen his followers to bee trampled vnder their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:663:140"/> feete and made their prey: If wee looke not to this (moſt holy father) how shall wee anſwer Chriſt in the day of iudgment? who will reſiſt Antichriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, if wee ſuffer thus the vices and offenſes of his forerunners? with ſuch induring as this, Potentates growe prowde, the kinges of Nations turne to bee Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes, and imagine the Church ought to haue no right, no priuiledge, but depending only on their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: but bleſſed is hee who houldeth and dasheth the litle ones on the rocke. For if Iudas beeing comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the lawe rooteth not out the Cannonytes, they will growe vp to bee perpetually his Aduerſary and his ſtinge. Bee therfore (father) of good comforte, and bee a couragious commander, wee haue more on our ſyde then they haue on theirs; God hath broken in peeces Fredericke the hammer of the impious, beeing ready alſo shortly to ſtrike others vnles they amend and haue peace with the Church of God.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, wee only expect the ſentence of your mouth, or of his who hath bin accuſtomed to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue Princes of their ſpiritts, and deliuer the poore from the potent. You shall receaue more by word of mouth which wee thought inconuenient to committ to wryting. Let your excellency bee thus perſwaded, that if wee would from the beeginning haue giuen way to theſe wicked cuſtomes, wee needed not now inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of any Cardinall, nor yet of any man liuing. In vayne (God willing) doe they lay beefore our eyes the examples of the Cicilians or Hungarians: which at the day of Iudgment cannot excuſe vs, if wee preferre the barbariſme of Tyrantes before Apoſtolicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and beeleiue the vſurping pryde of wordly powers to bee rather a rule to directe our life, then the Eternall Teſtament confirmed with the bloud and death of the ſonne of God.

And many times after as

Which when they abſolutely denyed, the king grew angry, and made a new requeſt: that at the leaſt one of them would paſſe ouer while the other remayned there, and if that were diſtaſtefull to them they would ſend but one of their Cleakes, whom hee would enrich with reuenues beefore his returne: all which when Gratian (who as wee hope is the ſonne of grace) againe denyed, my lord the king beeing very much inraged, departed away ſaying in their hearing, Doe what you like, I weigh neither you nor your exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Afterwardes hauing waſted a little tyme in indigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe letters, and the king as one enflamed with a wonderfull fury, leauing them often, the Bishoppes comminge to him ſayde, what would theſe Nuntios haue? And showing him my Lord the Popes Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, inioyninge them to accomplish the Nuntios commandement, the king anſwered, I know, I know, they will interdict my land, but cannot I, who am eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day able to take a moſt ſtrong Caſtle, take one Clearke who shall interdict my land? Yet when in the end they yeelded in ſome degree to ſatisfy his deſire, the tempeſt of his anger was layde, and returning to himſelfe hee ſayde: vnles yee conclude this night a peace, yee shall neuer come ſo neere this point againe, and when they had awhile trauelled in the buſines, aſſembling them all together, hee vſed theſe wordes: It is conuenient I should doe very much at the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Lord the Pope, beecauſe hee is our Lord and father, in regarde wherof I reſtore to the Archbishoppe his Sea with my peace, and the like to all thoſe who for his ſake haue departed the land.

Then was it required of the Nuntios, that all they vpon whom my Lord the king in this tyme of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance had beeſtowed your Churches might enioy them according to the tenor of his Maieſties guifte: but as wee heard, the concluſion was that they should bee left free to your diſpoſition. Afterwards it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Bishoppes should ſet downe in wryting the forme of peace which the king had granted. And this did the king to the end that one of the Nuntios should paſſe ouer into England for abſoluing the excommmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. And beeing departed vpon theſe termes after three howers within night, the king ſayde hee would haue inſerted in the articles of peace theſe wordes; <hi>with the reſeruation of the dignity of his kingdome;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (as wee heard) Gratian abſolutely denyed euer to yeilde, and vpon this word as yet they differ, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to returne on the Natiuity of Saint Mary the Virgen to Cane, there finally to conclude more fully the whole buſines.

                     <p>Thou haſt giuen him (ô Lord) the deſire of his harte, for hee was long a ſouldier vnder thy banner, keepeing warily ſeuere wayes in regarde of the wordes proceeding from thy lippes.

Hee was à Preacher of the diuine worde, a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Goſpell, a freind of the spouſe, a pillar of the Clergie, an eye to the blinde, a foote to the lame, the ſalte of this earth, the light of his countrey, the Miniſter of the higheſt, the Vicar of the anoynted of our Lord.

Firſt were Iohn Cumin and Maſter B. ſent to ſeeke abſolution for the Bishoppes; but Iohn Cumin came to the courte fifteene dayes beefore Maſter B. and after great importunity, hauing firſt made a promiſe of 500.

               <p>The next Meſſingers were the Bishoppes of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter and Ewreux, the Abbot of Valace, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons of Salisbury and Lizieux, S.

Afterwards vpon ſute of ſome Cardinalls, the Abbot and Archdeacon of Lizieux were receaued.</p>
               <p>Thurſday before Eaſter approaching, it was generally ſayde in the Courte, that my Lord the Pope would that day pronounce ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication againſt the king, and kingdome: Wherupon the Meſſingers ſtroaken with feare, by the interceſſion of ſome Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, ſignifyed to my Lord the Pope, that they had receaued commandement from my Lord their king to make oathe in his preſence, that the king should obey his Mandate, and that the king should in his owne perſon ſweare as much. The ſame Thurſday about nyne of the clocke, as well the kinges meſſingers as the meſſingers of the Bishoppes were called in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Conſiſtory. The kinges Meſſingers beeing the Abbot of Valace and the two afore recyted Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons Henry and Richarde Barre were ſworne, that the king should ſtand to the Popes iudgment, and that when his Holines should commande him, hee should take thereupon his Corporall oathe.

               <p>After Eaſter came the Bishoppes of Worceſter and Eureux with Robert de Newboroughe,<note place="margin">The Relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinges with the Pope.</note> and whether the ſayde oath were required of them, I knowe not, but that they ſwore not, I am certaine; and when they had attended the Courte xv. dayes and more, they were called in to receaue their anſwer; for they with others agreede as well in excuſing the king, as in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing, according as hath bin ſayde: And when it was ſuppoſed they should haue caryed backe a happie doome, my Lord the Pope confirmed the ſentence of interdiction giuen by the Bishoppe of Senon againſt the kinges dominions on this ſyde of the Seas, with the ſentence of ſuſpenſion and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication which was denounced againſt the Bishoppes of England; adding withall that hee would ſend his Legates to the king to ſee and vnderſtand his humility. Afterwardes at the great inſtance of the Meſſingers, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion alſo of ſome Cardinalls and large ſommes of money (as it is ſayde) this was obtayned: our Lord the Pope should wryte to the Archdeacon of Bitureux, that if within one moneth after theſe Meſſingers comming into Normandy hee hearde not his Legates had paſſed the Alpes, then hee should abſolue the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of London and Salisbury from excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, firſt taking of them an oathe to obey our Lord the Popes Mandate, they and the reſt remayning neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe ſtill in ſuſpenſion. Thus departed our Lord the kinges Meſſingers from the courte, neither yet caryed they backe any thing elſe. But when they shall come, or who shall vndertake this iourney, I thinke it

                     <p>In regarde wee ſuppoſe you are deſirous to heare of our ſtate, and the good ſucceſſe of the buſines commended to our charge, wee thought conuenient to ſignify to your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood by theſe letters how God hath at this tyme dealte with vs, and wrought by the miniſtery of our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines. Bee yee therfore certifyed, that after the renowned king of England knewe by certayne relation that wee were come within his Dominion, ſetting aſyde all obſtacles of delay, hee preſently returned from Ireland into England, lettinge paſſe the buſineſſes which then imported him, and from England arriued on the coaſte of Normandy, ſending inſtantly ſundry Meſsingers and honorable perſonages from vs to vnderſtand at what place wee thought moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently to meete him and treate of theſe affaires. It pleaſed vs at length to meete at the Monaſtery of Sauyne, that wee might there confer, where wee should bee aſsiſted by the prayers of the Religious. Wee mett there together, and there mett with vs many perſons of eyther order of his kingdome, and wee treated as dilligently as wee could of what appertayned to the good of him, and the charge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on vs. But not aggreeing in all pointes, hee departed from vs, pretending to paſſe into England, wee expected, intending the next day to goe to the Citty of Abryncke. On
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:663:223"/> the morrowe, came to vs the Bishoppe of Lizieux, with two Archdeacons, and condeſcending to our requeſt wee paſſed on to the ſayde Citty; whether on the Sunday in which is fung <hi>vocem iucunditatis</hi> wee aſſembled with very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons and they alſo with vs: and with ſoe much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility hee accomplished what was promiſed, as without all doubt wee may beeleeue it was his worke, who looketh on the earth and maketh it tremble. Truly to declare how much hee endeauored to humble himſelfe to God, and shewe his obedience to the Church, it is not a matter in theſe few lynes to bee vttered, his deedes doe ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt it, and heereafter will manifeſt it more fully, as wee aſſuredly hope it will appeare.</p>
                     <p>Firſt therfore not vpon any conſtrainte or requeſt of ours, but of his owne free will, hee cleered his conſcience by an oathe vpon the holy Euangeliſtes concerning the death of Thomas of bleſſed memory late Archbishoppe of Canterbury, ſwearing that hee neither commanded nor wished that the Archbishop should bee killed, and vpon the reporte therof, hee was exceedingly greiued. Yet bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the murder was committed, and hee feared hee gaue occaſion therof, for making ſatisfaction, hee tooke this oathe. Firſt hee ſwore hee would neuer leaue our Lord Pope Alexander and his Catholicke ſucceſſors, ſo long as they vſed him like a Catholicke and Chriſtian king, and this alſoe hee cauſed his ſonne and heire to ſweare in the Charter of abſolution for the death of bleſſed Thomas.

But this wee haue written, that you may ſee his obedience to Allmighty God, and how hee is farre more incouraged then hitherto hee hath bin, to the ſeruice of his Sauiour.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:663:224"/> Knowe beeſides that his ſonne concerning the vnlawfull cuſtomes hath made oathe ioyntly with him.
